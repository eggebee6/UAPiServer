# UAPiServer
### An OPC UA server for the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT

[OPC Unified Architecture](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/) (OPC UA) is a communication architecture for IoT and similar applications.  OPC UA is an open-source standard (IEC62541).  It's a service-oriented architecture with a security-first approach and a self-describing address space.

This project is a C# implementation of an OPC UA server for the Sense HAT on a Raspberry Pi.  It allows the sensors to be read remotely and the LED matrix to be turned on and off.

## Development
Active work should merged into the `dev` branch, preferably through a pull request with appropriate review.  Adding unit testing, CI/CD, examples, and **improving documentation** would be fantastic.  The `main` branch should be reserved for clean, tested code.

## Miscellaneous
Not a serious project yet, but feel free to help make it one.
